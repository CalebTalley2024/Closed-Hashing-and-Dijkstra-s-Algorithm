# HW 5
## Q1-3: Hash Table
# Q1 - ~ 1-2 hrs

# Q2 - ~ 1-2 hrs
- Problem: remember to change the isValid function to work for the Poe txt file, NOT Raven
# Q3 - ~ 3-4 hrs

# Q4: Dijsktra's Algorithm - Bonus
- When typing input, make sure to Only use single Capital letters
- Easter Egg: When you go from the first node (A) and the last node (D), the sequence is "[A, R, T, S, K, J, I, D]", which is "Dijkstra" spelled backwards


Hash table cannot have null vals while hashmap can
Problem: add scanner, and sequence of nodes for the shortest path
